Scoperead.py is the 'header' file with the modules that you would need to communicate with the scope. Store this file in your current working directory.
The programme ScopeRead_Example.py is an example that shows how to use these functions, and what variables they return. 

There are dependencies on pymeasure, pyvisa, etc. Please read the document that details how to set up your Raspberry Pi before you start to work with this.
