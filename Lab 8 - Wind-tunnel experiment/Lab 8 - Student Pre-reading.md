The Lab 8 - Wind-tunnel will built upon the previous lab in using the differential pressure sensor.

The learning goal is to understand the functional principles of wind tunnels, the main components and the different type of wind tunnels with a focus on the measurement & instrumentation principles used in the operation of wind tunnels. 

To be prepared for the quiz and tha lab please check the following reading material:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure --> Know the sea level standard atmospheric pressure in [Pa]

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot_tube --> Know the functional principle of a pitot-static tube and the roles of the different pressure types

- https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/42327 --> From this link chapter 3.6 power plant. Know the relation between input power and volumetric flow rate



The following three links give you an overview of the different wind tunnel types and their applications:
