In this lab, you will characterize a Wheatstone Bridge, which you will then use for characterizing unknown resistances. The lab in itself has some learning outcomes, which are given in the lab manual. But going beyond the immediate learning outcomes, this lab is designed to give you an idea of the workflow of a typical experiment. 



It starts with estimating values to get an idea of the magnitude of numbers you expect to encounter in your experiment. This exercise is important to ensure you don't kill your experiment even before you start it. 



Next, you will be doing the actual experiment and making some observations along the way. This step is similar to what you have done in the past few experiments. 



However the major difference now will be that you will be comparing your experimental observations with the simulation results you have obtained. This is a crucial step for any experiment - you have a hypothesis, you perform an experiment, and then you evaluate your experimental results in light of your hypothesis. If they agree, well and good. If they do not, that means there is more work to do. 



For this lab, you will have to listen to Lecture 3.x - Instrumentation - The Wheatstone Bridge (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0sPA4giPTENll0sd3qB5lYYnFC6VGtM/view?usp=sharing). There, I go into details of the physics of the bridge, and it will inform your experimental activity. This together with your experimental results and codes from your previous experiment will form the knowledgebase that you will need for this experiment. Please come to the lab only after watching this Lecture (it is 50 minutes long, you cannot watch it during the lab session :) ).
