In this lab, you will be calibrating a PT-100 Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) for measuring temperatures. 

The tasks in this lab are as follows - 

1. Connecting a Peltier element* (non-graded)

2. Calibrating the Peltier element temperature from 5-50 degrees Celsius (plot a temperature vs. Peltier current graph). 

3. Getting an order of magnitude of resistance change with temperature for the PT100.

4. Numerically simulate a Wheatstone bridge that will be used to measure the resistance of the PT100 over temperatures. 

IMPORTANT - choose a value of the source voltage and/or resistance values so that Vb and Vd do not exceed +/-0.5 V. 

5. Build the Wheatstone bridge, and use it to calibrate and find the temperature coefficient of resistance of the PT100 sensor. 

6. OPTIONAL TASK - Determine the gain values and circuit configuration necessary for connecting an INA126 instrumentation amplifier to amplify the signal from the Wheatstone bridge. 

7. OPTIONAL TASK - Incorporate the INA126 amplifier in the Wheatstone bridge configuration you have currently realized, and verify the amplified operation of your PT100 configuration. 

Please see the demo lab video for more details.
