# Suggested Bill of Materials

This is more or less the make-up of our individual kits. With these components, one can realize a decent set of experiments, and also let the students play around and come up with their own innovations. If you are building your lab from scratch, keep in mind the costs for the oscilloscope and computer screen. You may consider using a USB-addressable multimeter for some of the experiments. 

1. Raspberry Pi kit
    - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
    - HDMI Cable (check the connecctor size - micro-HDMI is required for RPi 4)
    - SD Card - 32 GB
    - Raspberry Pi power supply
    - Keyboard + mouse (wireless option recommended)
    - LAN cable if required
2. Sensors and actuators
    - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
    - MPU6050 - 3-axis accelerometer
    - Digital thermometer
    - RTD (PT-100)
    - Thermistor - NTC
    - Pressure sensor D6F-PH0505AD3
    - Replacement cable for TF mini LIDAR sensor 
    - 180^0 servo
    - 360^0 servo
    - Stepper motor (~4.2 kg-cm version should be enough)
    - Stepper motor driver (recommended - L298N)
3. Other electronic components
    - Battery - 9 V with adaptor
    - Peltier heating/cooling tile (see documents for Experiment 6)
    - Heat sink
    - Heat sink paste
    - Linear potentiometer (for calibration)
    - Trimpot for fine adjustment
    - MCP3008 - Analog to Digital Sensor
    - INA126 Instrumentation amplifier
    - LM324N PDIP-14 Operational Amplifier
    - LM741CN PDIP-8 Operational Amplifier
    - Multimeter
    - Assorted resistors, capacitors
    - Jumper cables (M-F) for connected RPi to breadboard
    - Breadboards
    - Trimpot
 4. Wind-tunnel related components
    - Anemometer
    - C-Fan 80x80 mm 5V
    - Copper tubeÂ 
    - Acrylic tube diameter 80 mm
    - Paper straws and duct tape
    - Acrylic sheet 12x12 inch
    - Acrylic glue
    - M3 screws and nuts 
5. Other resources
    - Computer monitor
    - HDMI-VGA adapter if required
    - Oscilloscope (codes provided in this repository are Keysight DSOX1102G-ready)
    - Voltage source (will be used for driving the Peltier element and instrumentation amplifiers)
    - Tripod (for webcam)
    - HD-webcam (for online mode)
